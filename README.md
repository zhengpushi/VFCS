# VFCS

***This is an on-going project***
* created at: July 13, 2022*


## 1. What is VFCS?

* Verified Flight Control System (VFCS) is an academic project for study the FCS software by theorem prover Coq.
* We adopt the idea of construct-correct to analysis, modeling and design the FCS.
* Coq proof assistant is a higher-order logic theorem prover based on Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
* We mainly study the Multicopter at the first stage.

## 2. Why start the project ?

* FCS is a safety critical software system, and it's reliability is hard to promise by traditional Disign-Build-Test aproch.
* The FCS is a comprehensive engineering system, and many special knowledge, experience data and mathematical theory need to be formal described , organized and verified. Meanwhile, these knowledge and theory are existed in many similiar system. 
* So, it is a fundamental research topic with huge potential benefits

## 3. Who are we?

* We are a team focusing on formal engineering mathematics study, and located in Nanjing University of  Aeronautics and Astronautics, in China.
* Author: ZhengPu Shi (zhengpushi@nuaa.edu.cn) 

## 4. Dependented projects

* [CoqExt](https://github.com/zhengpushi/CoqExt): Extension of Coq Standard Libray. [Homepage]
* [CoqMatrix](https://github.com/zhengpushi/CoqMatrix): Formal matrix theory with multiple implementations in Coq.
